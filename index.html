  <h1>William — Architecture Notebook</h1>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I work from the structure of the domain, not from patterns or frameworks. My background isn’t defined by formal training or adherence to established methodologies. My work has always grown out of the realities of the problem space itself — the constraints, the boundaries, and the pressures that shape what a system can become.
  </p>
  <p>
    I document these systems not to highlight myself, but to make the reasoning visible. Architecture, for me, is an applied discipline grounded in observation, not a catalog of patterns to be selected.

  <h2>Opening Page</h2>
  <p>
    Architecture is often described in terms of patterns, frameworks, and abstractions — as if the work begins with a catalog of shapes and the task is to choose the right one. My experience has never worked that way.
  </p>
  <p>
    Real systems begin with the domain itself. With its constraints. With its contradictions. With the pressures it applies and the boundaries it reveals.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you pay attention to those forces, the architecture doesn’t feel like something you invent. It feels like something you uncover — the structure that was already there, waiting to be recognized.
  </p>
  <p>
    This notebook is a record of that process.
  </p>
  <p>
    It isn’t a portfolio, and it isn’t a retrospective. It’s simply a place to document how certain systems came into being: what the domain demanded, what the constraints allowed, and how the solution emerged from that interaction. Some of these systems were small. Some ended up shaping entire markets. All of them followed the same path: start with reality, and let the structure reveal itself.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is a theme here, it’s that architecture is not an act of creativity or preference. It is an act of observation.
  </p>
  <p>
    These entries are my attempt to make that visible.
